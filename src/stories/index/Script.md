Make, a 3d web game.


First, Download and install, Node.js.
Then, run these commands to continue:
- Command #1: ``` npx create next app; with these options```.
  - This creates a copy of a website template, from a Next.js web app.
- Command #2 and 3: ``` cd name, and make dir; script, constant, jason, et cetera.```.
  - This updates your console index and organizes your project structure following the recommended schema.
- and;
- Command #4: ``` npm install; react three drei. dot-dot-dot.```.
  - This installs all libraries needed for the project.
- Finally: ```npm run dev```. This starts a development server, at local-host.

Implement a basic counter:
- Create a react hook state, for the game logic
- and;
- Update the UI to display the output.
