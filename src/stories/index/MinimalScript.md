Make a 3d web game, in 60 seconds, (You'll need Node.js),




First, open a console, like this; and run these 5 commands,
- #1: ``` npx, create next app; and all, these options```,
  - This creates a template website, using Next.js,
- #2: ``` cd, my game zero```,
  - This changes the directory of the console,
- #3: ``` make, dir; script, source model and dom```,
  - This creates some new folders,
- and,
- #4: ``` npm, install; three, react three drei, and fiber```,
  - This downloads, all dependencies.
- Finally: ```npm, run dev```; to start a development server, at local-host,

Second. lets add some code,
- Create a state machine, with react hooks, for the game logic, with this code.
- and now;
- Update, the UI, to display the output, like this.

Third.
- Create, 3d component, with a click handler, and use the previous counter state.
- Finally; put it all together, and play
