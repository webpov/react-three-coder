# DOM: Document Object Models
### dom atom
DOM Atoms are generally the bare minimum component from which other components are built
subfolders:
  * common: placeholder, error
  * input: text, option
  * overlay: alert, modal, popup

### dom cell
DOM Cells are UI items ready to be used in layouts and most likely hold a complex state and nested component structure
subfolders:
  * display: slider
  * system: table, pagination

### dom organ
DOM Organs are meant to be used along other components as main sections of a page
subfolders:
  * layout: sidebar

MODEL Core are 3d entities needed in all 3d layouts and most likely hold a base funcionalities like cameras and text or primitve objects
### Model Directory Structure

#### `model/core/`
This folder contains essential 3D entities required in all 3D layouts. It includes foundational functionalities such as camera systems, text, and primitive objects, forming the backbone for basic 3D components in any 3D scene or application.

#### `model/npc/`
The 'npc' (non-player character) folder houses 3D models and functionalities related to characters in the application that are not controlled by the user. It encompasses AI-driven characters, bystanders, or any autonomous entities within the 3D environment.

#### `model/part/`
This directory holds specific parts or components of 3D models. These parts are used to assemble more complex 3D models or to provide modular components for customization and interchangeability within the 3D environment. these components are essential but not required for the most basic of scenes.

#### `model/tools/`
The 'tools' folder contains utilities and scripts that assist in the creation, manipulation, or interaction with 3D models. It includes tools for modeling, rigging, animating, and scripting functionalities in the 3D space. These are usable by characters, scenes, players or the user.

#### `model/level/`
This section is dedicated to the creation and organization of different levels or environments within the 3D web app. It features various base scenes, level settings, or worlds that are integral to the flow of the 3D application or game.
