The `Canvas` object is where you start to define your React Three Fiber Scene.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'

const App = () => (
  <Canvas>
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <mesh>
      <sphereGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
    </mesh>
  </Canvas>
)
```

## Render defaults

Canvas uses [createRoot](#createroot) which will create a translucent `THREE.WebGLRenderer` with the following constructor args:

- antialias=true
- alpha=true
- powerPreference="high-performance"

and with the following properties:

- outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace
- toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping

It will also create the following scene internals:

- A `THREE.Perspective` camera
- A `THREE.Orthographic` cam if `orthographic` is true
- A `THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap` if `shadows` is true
- A `THREE.Scene` (into which all the JSX is rendered) and a `THREE.Raycaster`

In recent versions of threejs, `THREE.ColorManagement.enabled` will be set to `true` to enable automatic conversion of colors according to the renderer's configured color space. R3F will handle texture color space conversion. For more on this topic, see [https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Color-management](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Color-management).

## Custom Canvas

R3F can render to a root, similar to how `react-dom` and all the other React renderers work. This allows you to shave off `react-dom` (~40kb), `react-use-measure` (~3kb) and, if you don't need them, `pointer-events` (~7kb) (you need to explicitly import `events` and add them to the config otherwise).

Roots have the same options and properties as `Canvas`, but you are responsible for resizing it. It requires an existing DOM `<canvas>` object into which it renders.

### CreateRoot

Creates a root targeting a canvas, rendering JSX.

```jsx
import * as THREE from 'three'
import { extend, createRoot, events } from '@react-three/fiber'

// Register the THREE namespace as native JSX elements.
// See below for notes on tree-shaking
extend(THREE)

// Create a react root
const root = createRoot(document.querySelector('canvas'))

// Configure the root, inject events optionally, set camera, etc
root.configure({ events, camera: { position: [0, 0, 50] } })

// createRoot by design is not responsive, you have to take care of resize yourself
window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
  root.configure({ size: { width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight } })
})

// Trigger resize
window.dispatchEvent(new Event('resize'))

// Render entry point
root.render(<App />)

// Unmount and dispose of memory
// root.unmount()
```

## Tree-shaking

New with v8, the underlying reconciler no longer pulls in the THREE namespace automatically.

This enables a granular catalogue which also enables tree-shaking via the `extend` API:

```jsx
import { extend, createRoot } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { Mesh, BoxGeometry, MeshStandardMaterial } from 'three'

extend({ Mesh, BoxGeometry, MeshStandardMaterial })

createRoot(canvas).render(
  <>
    <mesh>
      <boxGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial />
    </mesh>
  </>,
)
```

There's an [official babel plugin](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-babel) which will do this for you automatically:

```jsx
// In:

import { createRoot } from '@react-three/fiber'

createRoot(canvasNode).render(
  <mesh>
    <boxGeometry />
    <meshStandardMaterial />
  </mesh>,
)

// Out:

import { createRoot, extend } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { Mesh as _Mesh, BoxGeometry as _BoxGeometry, MeshStandardMaterial as _MeshStandardMaterial } from 'three'

extend({
  Mesh: _Mesh,
  BoxGeometry: _BoxGeometry,
  MeshStandardMaterial: _MeshStandardMaterial,
})

createRoot(canvasNode).render(
  <mesh>
    <boxGeometry />
    <meshStandardMaterial />
  </mesh>,
)
```

# Objects, properties and constructor
---
title: Objects, properties and constructor arguments
description: 'All the effective ways of using React Three Fiber'
nav: 6
---

## Declaring objects

You can use [three.js's entire object catalogue and all properties](https://threejs.org/docs). When in doubt, always consult the docs.

❌ You could lay out an object like this:

```jsx
<mesh
  visible
  userData={{ hello: 'world' }}
  position={new THREE.Vector3(1, 2, 3)}
  rotation={new THREE.Euler(Math.PI / 2, 0, 0)}
  geometry={new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 16, 16)}
  material={new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: new THREE.Color('hotpink'), transparent: true })}
/>
```

✅ The problem is that all of these properties will always be re-created. Instead, you should define properties declaratively.

```jsx
<mesh visible userData={{ hello: 'world' }} position={[1, 2, 3]} rotation={[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}>
  <sphereGeometry args={[1, 16, 16]} />
  <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" transparent />
</mesh>
```

## Constructor arguments

In three.js objects are classes that are instantiated. These classes can receive one-time constructor arguments (`new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32)`), and properties (`someObject.visible = true`). In React Three Fiber, constructor arguments are always passed as an array via `args`. If args change later on, the object must naturally get reconstructed from scratch!

```jsx
<sphereGeometry args={[1, 32]} />
```

## Shortcuts

### Set

All properties whose underlying object has a `.set()` method can directly receive the same arguments that `set` would otherwise take. For example [`THREE.Color.set`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Color.set) can take a color string, so instead of `color={new THREE.Color('hotpink')}` you can simply write `color="hotpink"`. Some `set` methods take multiple arguments, for instance [`THREE.Vector3`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Vector3.set), give it an array in that case `position={[100, 0, 0]}`.

```jsx
<mesh position={[1, 2, 3]} />
  <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
```

Hint
  If you do link up an existing object to a property, for instance a THREE.Vector3() to a position, be aware that this
  will end up copying the object in most cases as it calls .copy() on the target. This only applies to objects that
  expose both .set() and .copy() (Vectors, Eulers, Matrix, ...). If you link up an existing material or geometry on the
  other hand, it will overwrite, because more these objects do not have a .set() method.
Hint

### SetScalar

Properties that have a `setScalar` method (for instance `Vector3`) can be set like so:

```jsx
// Translates to <mesh scale={[1, 1, 1]} />
<mesh scale={1} />
```

## Piercing into nested properties

If you want to reach into nested attributes (for instance: `mesh.rotation.x`), just use dash-case.

```jsx
<mesh rotation-x={1} material-uniforms-resolution-value={[512, 512]} />
```

## Dealing with non-scene objects

You can put non-Object3D primitives (geometries, materials, etc) into the render tree as well. They take the same properties and constructor arguments they normally would.

You might be wondering why you would want to put something in the "scene" that normally would not be part of it, in a vanilla three.js app at least. For the same reason you declare any object: it becomes managed, reactive and auto-disposes. These objects are not technically part of the scene, but they "attach" to a parent which is.

### Attach

Use `attach` to bind objects to their parent. If you unmount the attached object it will be taken off its parent automatically.

The following attaches a material to the `material` property of a mesh and a geometry to the `geometry` property:

```jsx
<mesh>
  <meshBasicMaterial attach="material" />
  <boxGeometry attach="geometry" />
```

Hint

All objects extending `THREE.Material` receive `attach="material"`, and all objects extending `THREE.BufferGeometry` receive
`attach="geometry"`. You do not have to type it out!

Hint

```jsx
<mesh>
  <meshBasicMaterial />
  <boxGeometry />
```

You can also deeply nest attach through piercing. The following adds a buffer-attribute to `geometry.attributes.position` and then adds the buffer geometry to `mesh.geometry`.

```jsx
<mesh>
  <bufferGeometry>
    <bufferAttribute attach="attributes-position" count={v.length / 3} array={v} itemSize={3} />
```

#### More examples

```jsx
// Attach bar to foo.a
<foo>
  <bar attach="a" />

// Attach bar to foo.a.b and foo.a.b.c (nested object attach)
<foo>
  <bar attach="a-b" />
  <bar attach="a-b-c" />

// Attach bar to foo.a[0] and foo.a[1] (array attach is just object attach)
<foo>
  <bar attach="a-0" />
  <bar attach="a-1" />

// Attach bar to foo via explicit add/remove functions
<foo>
  <bar attach={(parent, self) => {
    parent.add(self)
    return () => parent.remove(self)
  }} />

// The same as a one liner
<foo>
  <bar attach={(parent, self) => (parent.add(self), () => parent.remove(self))} />
```

#### Real-world use-cases:

Attaching to nested objects, for instance a shadow-camera:

```diff
- <directionalLight
-   castShadow
-   position={[2.5, 8, 5]}
-   shadow-mapSize={[1024, 1024]}
-   shadow-camera-far={50}
-   shadow-camera-left={-10}
-   shadow-camera-right={10}
-   shadow-camera-top={10}
-   shadow-camera-bottom={-10}
- />
+ <directionalLight castShadow position={[2.5, 8, 5]} shadow-mapSize={[1024, 1024]}>
+   <orthographicCamera attach="shadow-camera" args={[-10, 10, 10, -10]} />
+ </directionalLight>
```

Arrays must have explicit order, for instance multi-materials:

```jsx
<mesh>
  {colors.map((color, index) => <meshBasicMaterial key={index} attach={`material-${index}`} color={color} />}
</mesh>
```

## Putting already existing objects into the scene-graph

You can use the `primitive` placeholder for that. You can still give it properties or attach nodes to it. Never add the same object multiple times, this is not allowed in three.js! Primitives will not dispose of the object they carry on unmount, you are responsible for disposing of it!

```jsx
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)

function Component() {
  return <primitive object={mesh} position={[10, 0, 0]} />
```

## Using 3rd-party objects declaratively

The `extend` function extends React Three Fiber's catalogue of JSX elements. Components added this way can then be referenced in the scene-graph using camel casing similar to other primitives.

```jsx
import { extend } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls, TransformControls } from 'three-stdlib'
extend({ OrbitControls, TransformControls })

// ...
return (
  <>
    <orbitControls />
    <transformControls />
```

If you're using TypeScript, you'll also need to [extend the JSX namespace](/react-three-fiber/tutorials/typescript#extending-jsx-intrinsic-elements).

## Disposal

Freeing resources is a [manual chore in `three.js`](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-dispose-of-objects), but React is aware of object-lifecycles, hence React Three Fiber will attempt to free resources for you by calling `object.dispose()`, if present, on all unmounted objects.

If you manage assets by yourself, globally or in a cache, this may _not_ be what you want. You can switch it off by placing `dispose={null}` onto meshes, materials, etc, or even on parent containers like groups, it is now valid for the entire tree.

```jsx
const globalGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry()
const globalMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial()

function Mesh() {
  return (
    <group dispose={null}>
      <mesh geometry={globalGeometry} material={globalMaterial} />
```







##### Section: API
# Hooks
---
title: Hooks
description: Hooks are the heart of react-three-fiber
nav: 7
---

Hooks allow you to tie or request specific information to your component. For instance, components that want to participate in the renderloop can use `useFrame`, components that need to be informed of three.js specifics can use `useThree` and so on. All hooks clean up after themselves once the component unmounts.

HintHooks can only be used inside the Canvas element because they rely on context!Hint

❌ You cannot expect something like this to work:

```jsx
import { useThree } from '@react-three/fiber'

function App() {
  const { size } = useThree() // This will just crash
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <mesh>
```

✅ Do this instead:

```jsx
function Foo() {
  const { size } = useThree()
  ...
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <Foo />
```

## useThree

This hook gives you access to the state model which contains the default renderer, the scene, your camera, and so on. It also gives you the current size of the canvas in screen and viewport coordinates.

```jsx
import { useThree } from '@react-three/fiber'

function Foo() {
  const state = useThree()
```

The hook is reactive, if you resize the browser for instance, you get fresh measurements, same applies to any of the state objects that may change.

### Selector

You can also select properties, this allows you to avoid needless re-render for components that are interested only in particulars. Reactivity does not include deeper three.js internals!

```jsx
// Will only trigger re-render when the default camera is exchanged
const camera = useThree((state) => state.camera)
// Will only re-render on resize changes
const viewport = useThree((state) => state.viewport)
// ❌ You cannot expect reactivity from three.js internals!
const zoom = useThree((state) => state.camera.zoom)
```

### Reading state from outside of the component cycle

```jsx
function Foo() {
  const get = useThree((state) => state.get)
  ...
  get() // Get fresh state from anywhere you want
```

### Exchanging defaults

```jsx
function Foo() {
  const set = useThree((state) => state.set)
  ...
  useEffect(() => {
    set({ camera: new THREE.OrthographicCamera(...) })
  }, [])
```

## useFrame

This hook allows you to execute code on every rendered frame, like running effects, updating controls, and so on. You receive the state (same as `useThree`) and a clock delta. Your callback function will be invoked just before a frame is rendered. When the component unmounts it is unsubscribed automatically from the render-loop.

```jsx
import { useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'

function Foo() {
  useFrame((state, delta, xrFrame) => {
    // This function runs at the native refresh rate inside of a shared render-loop
  })
```

Hint
  Be careful about what you do inside useFrame! You should never setState in there! Your calculations should be slim and
  you should mind all the commonly known pitfalls when dealing with loops in general, like re-use of variables, etc.
Hint

### Taking over the render-loop

If you need more control you may pass a numerical `renderPriority` value. This will cause React Three Fiber to disable automatic rendering altogether. It will now be your responsibility to render, which is useful when you're working with effect composers, heads-up displays, etc.

```jsx
function Render() {
  // Takes over the render-loop, the user has the responsibility to render
  useFrame(({ gl, scene, camera }) => {
    gl.render(scene, camera)
  }, 1)

function RenderOnTop() {
  // This will execute *after* Render's useframe
  useFrame(({ gl, ... }) => {
    gl.render(...)
  }, 2)
```

Hint
  Callbacks will be executed in order of ascending priority values (lowest first, highest last.), similar to the DOM's
  z-order.
Hint

### Negative indices

Using negative indices will **not take over the render loop**, but it can be useful if you really must order the sequence of useFrames across the component tree.

```jsx
function A() {
  // This will execute first
  useFrame(() => ..., -2)

function B() {
  // This useFrame will execute *after* A's
  useFrame(() => ..., -1)
```

## useLoader

This hook loads assets and suspends for easier fallback- and error-handling. It can take any three.js loader as its first argument: GLTFLoader, OBJLoader, TextureLoader, FontLoader, etc. It is based on [React.Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense), so fallback-handling and [error-handling](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) happen at the parental level.

```jsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { useLoader } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader'

function Model() {
  const result = useLoader(GLTFLoader, '/model.glb')
  // You don't need to check for the presence of the result, when we're here
  // the result is guaranteed to be present since useLoader suspends the component
  return <primitive object={result.scene} />
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<FallbackComponent /> /* or null */}>
      <Model />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

Hint
  Assets loaded with useLoader are cached by default. The urls given serve as cache-keys. This allows you to re-use
  loaded data everywhere in the component tree.
Hint

Hint
  Be very careful with mutating or disposing of loaded assets, especially when you plan to re-use them. Refer to the
  automatic disposal section in the API.
Hint

### Loader extensions

You can provide a callback as the third argument if you need to configure your loader:

```jsx
import { DRACOLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/DRACOLoader'

useLoader(GLTFLoader, url, (loader) => {
  const dracoLoader = new DRACOLoader()
  dracoLoader.setDecoderPath('/draco-gltf/')
  loader.setDRACOLoader(dracoLoader)
})
```

### Loading multiple assets at once

It can also make multiple requests in parallel:

```jsx
const [bumpMap, specMap, normalMap] = useLoader(TextureLoader, [url1, url2, url2])
```

### Loading status

You can get the loading status from a callback you provide as the fourth argument. Though consider alternatives like THREE.DefaultLoadingManager or better yet, [Drei's](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) loading helpers.

```jsx
useLoader(loader, url, extensions, (xhr) => {
  console.log((xhr.loaded / xhr.total) * 100 + '% loaded')
})
```

### Special treatment of GLTFLoaders and all loaders that return a scene prop

If a `result.scene` prop is found the hook will automatically create a object & material collection: `{ nodes, materials }`. This lets you build immutable scene graphs selectively. You can also specifically alter the data without having to traverse it. [GLTFJSX](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx) specifically relies on this data.

```jsx
const { nodes, materials } = useLoader(GLTFLoader, url)
```

### Pre-loading assets

You can pre-load assets in global space so that models can be loaded in anticipation before they're mounted in the component tree.

```jsx
useLoader.preload(GLTFLoader, '/model.glb' /* extensions */)
```

## useGraph

Convenience hook which creates a memoized, named object/material collection from any [`Object3D`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D).

```jsx
import { useLoader, useGraph } from '@react-three/fiber'

function Model(url) {
  const scene = useLoader(OBJLoader, url)
  const { nodes, materials } = useGraph(scene)
  return <mesh geometry={nodes.robot.geometry} material={materials.metal} />
}
```







##### Section: API
# Events
---
title: Events
description: All the events you can hook up to
nav: 8
---

`three.js` objects that implement their own `raycast` method (meshes, lines, etc) can be interacted with by declaring events on them. We support pointer events, clicks and wheel-scroll. Events contain the browser event as well as the `three.js` event data (object, point, distance, etc). You may want to [polyfill](https://github.com/jquery/PEP) them, if that's a concern.

Additionally, there's a special `onUpdate` that is called every time the object gets fresh props, which is good for things like `self => (self.verticesNeedUpdate = true)`.

Also notice the `onPointerMissed` on the canvas element, which fires on clicks that haven't hit _any_ meshes.

```jsx
<mesh
  onClick={(e) => console.log('click')}
  onContextMenu={(e) => console.log('context menu')}
  onDoubleClick={(e) => console.log('double click')}
  onWheel={(e) => console.log('wheel spins')}
  onPointerUp={(e) => console.log('up')}
  onPointerDown={(e) => console.log('down')}

### Event data

```jsx
({
  ...DomEvent                   // All the original event data
  ...Intersection                 // All of Three's intersection data - see note 2
  intersections: Intersection[]    // The first intersection of each intersected object
  object: Object3D              // The object that was actually hit
  eventObject: Object3D         // The object that registered the event
  unprojectedPoint: Vector3     // Camera-unprojected point
  ray: Ray                      // The ray that was used to strike the object
  camera: Camera                // The camera that was used in the raycaster
  sourceEvent: DomEvent         // A reference to the host event
  delta: number                 // Distance between mouse down and mouse up event in pixels
}) => ...
```

### How the event-system works, bubbling and capture

Hint

`pointerenter` and `pointerleave` events work exactly the same as pointerover and pointerout.
`pointerenter` and `pointerleave` semantics are not implemented.

Hint

Hint

Some events (such as `pointerout`) happen when there is no intersection between `eventObject` and
the ray. When this happens, the event will contain intersection data from a previous event with
this object.

Hint

### Event propagation (bubbling)

Propagation works a bit differently to the DOM because objects can occlude each other in 3D. The `intersections` array in the event includes all objects intersecting the ray, not just the nearest. Only the first intersection with each object is included.
The event is first delivered to the object nearest the camera, and then bubbles up through its ancestors like in the DOM. After that, it is delivered to the next nearest object, and then its ancestors, and so on. This means objects are transparent to pointer events by default, even if the object handles the event.

`event.stopPropagation()` doesn't just stop this event from bubbling up, it also stops it from being delivered to farther objects (objects behind this one). All other objects, nearer or farther, no longer count as being hit while the pointer is over this object. If they were previously delivered pointerover events, they will immediately be delivered pointerout events. If you want an object to block pointer events from objects behind it, it needs to have an event handler as follows:

```jsx
onPointerOver={e => {
  e.stopPropagation()
  // ...
}}
```

even if you don't want this object to respond to the pointer event. If you do want to handle the event as well as using `stopPropagation()`, remember that the pointerout events will happen **during** the `stopPropagation()` call. You probably want your other event handling to happen after this.

### Pointer capture

Because events go to all intersected objects, capturing the pointer also works differently. In the DOM, the capturing object **replaces** the hit test, but in React Three Fiber, the capturing object is **added** to the hit test result: if the capturing object was not hit, then all of the hit objects (and their ancestors) get the event first, followed by the capturing object and its ancestors. The capturing object can also use `event.stopPropagation()` so that objects that really were hit get pointerout events.

Note that you can access the `setPointerCapture` and `releasePointerCapture` methods **only** via `event.target`: they don't get added to the `Object3D` instances in the scene graph.

`setPointerCapture` and `releasePointerCapture` take a `pointerId` parameter like in the DOM, but for now they don't have support for multiple active pointers. PRs are welcome!

```jsx
onPointerDown={e => {
  // Only the mesh closest to the camera will be processed
  e.stopPropagation()
  // You may optionally capture the target
  e.target.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId)
}}
onPointerUp={e => {
  e.stopPropagation()
  // Optionally release capture
  e.target.releasePointerCapture(e.pointerId)
}}
```

### Customizing the event settings

For some advanced usage it's possible to customize the setting of the event manager globally with the `events` prop on `<Canvas/>`:

```tsx
import { Canvas, events } from '@react-three/fiber'

const eventManagerFactory: Parameters<typeof Canvas>[0]['events'] = (state) => ({
  // Default configuration
  ...events(state),

  // Determines if the event layer is active
  enabled: true,

  // Event layer priority, higher prioritized layers come first and may stop(-propagate) lower layer
  priority: 1,

  // The filter can re-order or re-structure the intersections
  filter: (items: THREE.Intersection[], state: RootState) => items,

  // The compute defines how pointer events are translated into the raycaster and pointer vector2
  compute: (event: DomEvent, state: RootState, previous?: RootState) => {
    state.pointer.set((event.offsetX / state.size.width) * 2 - 1, -(event.offsetY / state.size.height) * 2 + 1)
    state.raycaster.setFromCamera(state.pointer, state.camera)
  },

  // Find more configuration default on ./packages/fiber/src/web/events.ts
  // And type definitions in ./packages/fiber/src/core/events.ts
})

function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas events={eventManagerFactory}>
}
```

### Using a different target element

There are cases in which you may want to connect the event handlers to another DOM element instead of the canvas. This is usually done to have events on a shared parent, which allows both the canvas, and dom overlays to receive events.

You can either use the event manager:

```jsx
const events => useThree(state => state.events)
useEffect(() => {
  state.events.connect(domNode)
```

Or, the `eventSource` shortcut on the canvas (DOM only), which accepts dom-nodes and React.RefObjects to dom-nodes.

```jsx
function App() {
  const target = useRef()
  return (
    <div ref={target}>
      <Canvas eventSource={target.current}>
```

### Using a different prefix (DOM only)

By default Fiber will use offsetX/offsetY to set up the raycaster. You can change this with the `eventPrefix` shortcut.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas eventPrefix="client">
```

### Allow raycast without user interaction

By default Fiber will only raycast when the user is interacting with the canvas. If, for instance, the camera moves a hoverable object underneath the cursor it will not trigger a hover event. If this is wanted behaviour you can force a raycast by executing `update()`, call it whenever necessary.

```jsx
const events => useThree(state => state.events)
useEffect(() => {
  // Will trigger a onPointerMove with the last-known pointer event
  state.events.update()
```

You can abstract this into more complex logic.

```jsx
function RaycastWhenCameraMoves() {
  const matrix = new THREE.Matrix4()
  useFrame((state) => {
    // Act only when the camera has moved
    if (!matrix.equals(state.camera.matrixWorld)) {
      state.events.update()
      matrix.copy(state.camera.matrixWorld)
    }
  })
}
```
